Thanks, that's super clear. Here's your finalized Replit AI prompt to generate a complete, 4-page animated React dashboard for your Telegram bot system — with data visualizations, chat console, Xendit balance integration, and a system maintenance panel.

🧠 Replit AI Prompt (Full 4-Page Telegram Bot Admin Dashboard):

> Build a futuristic, mobile-responsive React dashboard using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The frontend connects to a Telegram bot backend (e.g. https://tyangge24-7-1.onrender.com) and should have 4 animated pages, using Framer Motion, Recharts, and Lucide React.

🔧 Tech Stack:

React + TypeScript + Vite

Tailwind CSS (utility-first design)

Framer Motion (for animations)

Recharts (for animated graphs)

Axios (for API integration)

Lucide React (for icons)


✅ Pages:

1. 📦 Dashboard (/dashboard) – Order Management

View table of orders: Order No, Customer Name, Items, Delivery Info, Payment Status, Order Status

Change order status using animated controls (Received → Preparing → Enroute → Delivered)

View uploaded proof of payment from Telegram (image preview)

Animated graphs:

Orders per day (Bar Chart)

Top categories (Pie Chart)

Sales trend (Line Chart)


Mobile-first layout and swipe transitions



2. 💬 Chat Console (/messages) – Inbox Hub

Placeholder for Telegram and Messenger messages

Display list of incoming chats (dummy data ok)

Use Framer Motion to animate message panels



3. 💳 Xendit Panel (/xendit) – Payments & Balance

Call backend API (e.g. /api/xendit/balance) to show current Xendit account balance

Option to initiate withdrawal (trigger backend call)

Include animated wallet card UI

Chart for daily transactions



4. ⚙️ Maintenance (/system) – Bot & System Tools

Show system uptime, webhook status

Option to restart bot (via API)

Show version, build info

Animate system diagnostics using loading bars or icons




✨ UX Notes:

Use side navigation or tabbed bottom navbar for mobile

Add dark mode

Add Framer Motion for:

Page transitions

Chart reveals

Button feedback


Make it swipe-friendly on mobile


📌 QR generation and payments are handled by the backend — no upload UI needed.
